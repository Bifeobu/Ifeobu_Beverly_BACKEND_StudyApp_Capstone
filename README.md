This is the backend of my capstone, and it is using Node JS, Express JS and Mongoose for it's data application.
The 'https://ifeobu-beverly-backend-studyapp-capstone.onrender.com/check-in' route can POST a new form and GET all forms
The 'https://ifeobu-beverly-backend-studyapp-capstone.onrender.com/check-in/:id' route can PATCH/update an exsiting form and DELETE an exsiting form
